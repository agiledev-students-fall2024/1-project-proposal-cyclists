# Cyclable: DO NOT OCCUPY THE BIKE LANE

## What and Why?

Cyclable is a route planning web application designed to integrate user reports of road constructions and blockages on the bike lanes in New York City. This system will allow cyclists to plan smoother and safer routes by taking into account real-time information about disruptions. Routes are downloadable for use on bike computers or can be imported into other cycling apps.

Despite the existence of bike lanes in NYC, cyclists often face detours or are forced to share lanes with cars due to these disruptions. By incorporating user-reported data on bike lane blockages, Cyclable aims to enhance the cycling experience in the city, making it safer and more enjoyable for cyclists.

## For Whom?

Cyclable is intended for:

- **Cyclists in NYC**: Commuters, recreational riders, training cyclists and anyone who relies on cycling as a mode of transportation.
- **City planners and advocacy groups**: Organizations focused on improving cycling infrastructure and safety.

By targeting real cyclists who face these issues daily, the project aims to create a meaningful impact on their cycling experience.

## How?

From an end-user's perspective, the Cyclable system will:

1. **User Reporting**: Allow users to report blockages or construction in real-time, including details such as location and type of obstruction.
2. **Route Planning**: Generate cycling routes that avoid reported blockages and prioritize bike lanes, enhancing safety and efficiency.
3. **Map Interface**: Provide an interactive map displaying current bike lanes, reported issues, and alternative routes.
4. **Notifications**: Notify users of any new reports or changes in their planned routes due to user updates.

Potentially with: 5. **Photo Recognition**: Allow users to report accidents or blockages by simply taking a photo, which will be subsequently analyzed by computer vision algorithms for more detailed information.

The user interface will be intuitive, enabling users to quickly report issues and receive updated route information with minimal effort.

## Scope

The project will focus on the development of the first four functionalities for a group of 4 developers:

1. **User Reporting**: Allow users to report blockages or construction in real-time.
2. **Route Planning**: Generate cycling routes that avoid reported blockages and prioritize bike lanes.
3. **Map Interface**: Provide an interactive map displaying current bike lanes and reported issues.
4. **Notifications**: Notify users of any new reports or changes in their planned routes.

If time and energy allow, the fifth functionality—**Photo Recognition**—can be implemented as an extension of the core features.
